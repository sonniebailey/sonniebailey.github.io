Fairhaven Wealth offers a unique INSIGHT service that empowers you to make confident financial decisions aligned with your values. Through in-depth conversations, we help you gain clarity on your financial situation and future, without the conflicts of interest common when speaking with people in the financial services industry.

Below is a comprehensive overview relating to Fairhaven Wealth and its services. If you're thinking about engaging Fairhaven Wealth, I recommend that you read it in full.

## Isn't reading this entire document overkill?

If you think that this level of disclosure and detail is overkill, I completely understand! 

That's an indication that we might be on a different wavelength, and Fairhaven Wealth isn't a good fit for you. 

If, on the other hand, you value this level of transparency, and want to have a good amount of insight into how someone you're going to work with thinks and operates, then that's an indicator that Fairhaven Wealth's services could be a good fit. 

In a sense, the purpose of this document is to filter most people OUT. If there is part of this document that puts you off engaging Fairhaven Wealth, then that's fine! You can stop reading. 

If you read to the end, and you're still interested, then that's a sign to get in touch. 

## Are Fairhaven Wealth's services suitable for most people?

No.

Fairhaven Wealth provides a unique set of services. For some people, Fairhaven Wealth's services are ideal and could be one of the most valuable investments of time and money they've made. 

For most people, Fairhaven Wealth's services are not suitable and not worth the price. 

## Who or what is Fairhaven Wealth? 

When you work with Fairhaven Wealth, you work with me – Sonnie Bailey. 

In parts of this FAQ I have written this FAQ in the first person. However, all services provided by Fairhaven Wealth are provided via the Fairhaven Ventures Ltd. I am the sole director and shareholder of this company. 

I don't have any employees and don't plan on engaging any. 

## What service does Fairhaven Wealth provide?

Fairhaven Wealth provides a single service to all of its clients. I call it an "INSIGHT" service.

This service consists of two three-hour discussions, within approximately one week of each other, followed by one or more succinct emails, providing a high-level overview of what we discussed during each of the meetings.

## What do I get out of Fairhaven Wealth's service? 

It depends on who you are, what your situation is, and what you want out of life. 

I call it an INSIGHT service, because that is fundamentally what it's about. It's about helping to cultivate insight into your situation, so you can be more comfortable with the decisions that are available to you, so you can make them in a more informed and confident way. 

As part of this service, I am not going to tell you what to do. I am not going to make any decisions for you. It is about helping *you* make *your own decisions*. 

What *you* get out of the service is impossible to know, until we've had the conversations in question. The best I can do is to share different ways that clients of the previous iteration of Fairhaven Wealth's INSIGHT service benefitted. 

* Many clients have gained a much higher degree of comfort and confidence about their financial situation, and gained a more full appreciation that *they will be just fine*. (Keep in mind that most clients of Fairhaven Wealth aren't representative of the general population and are in privileged positions. That doesn't, however, mean that they have internalised this fact!)

* Clients with their own businesses have gained a greater sense of urgency in relation to succession arrangements for their businesses – often stemming from a recognition that the business is, or could be, a valuable asset, and also that the risk associated with them being a key person is potentially the biggest financial risk to which they're exposed. 

* Several clients have realised they can entertain a "sabbatical" from their current professional life, an early retirement, or a complete change in what they are currently doing, to something that is more personally rewarding, that might provide more valuable to the world, or that might be more financial beneficial over the longer run. 

* There are been many clients who, after going through their situation, and reflecting deeply on their values and what they don't want to happen, realise that they need to reframe the way they think of their physical health towards *investing* in it. 

* Similarly, some clients decide to spend more money on family holidays and special events. 

* Some clients have more thoughtfully reflected on their plans for the next generation. Some have decided to "give with a warm hand rather than a cold hand" (ie, be more generous during their lifetimes). Others have realised that they have to be more careful about how they assist family members, and it has prompted them to think more deeply about how to prepare their loved ones to be a greater steward of their inheritance. Some have thought about different ways to assist their loved ones – for example, by more actively assisting with education costs for grandchildren, or even assisting with insurance premiums (since for many clients and trustees, the insurable risks of their loved ones can often become their own risks, and the risks of other loved ones/beneficiaries). 

* Some clients have thought more concretely about the strategy for giving to causes they care about. 

* Some clients start to appreciate the value and importance of insurance. Others realise that they have more insurance than necessary, and that some or many of their insurances are less about managing risk and more about upside benefits. 

Some discussions centre more narrowly about a specific decision or set of decisions. But even with these conversations, these decisions are contextualised within the broader scope of their situations. Some conversations more narrowly about financial products. But again, these conversations are contextualised within the bigger picture, and are only discussed after stepping back and determining whether financial products are appropriate in the first place, and this is the appropriate level of granularity for the conversation. 

## How much does this service cost?

$6,000 including GST, but that is only if the service meets or exceeds your expectations. More on that below.

## Does this service result in any definitive advice? 

No. 

This service is called an "INSIGHT" service because it is not about *me* providing *advice* to *you*.

This service is about helping to elicit your own insight, to help you make your own informed decisions.

## Will I receive a financial plan or anything of the sort?

No. 

At the end of our engagement, you will receive one or more emails that will summarise some of the things we will have discussed.

## But you're registered as a financial adviser and provide disclosure documents as if you're an adviser. Why is this?  

Just in case I step over the line, especially when it comes to our discussions relating to financial products! 

The *Financial Markets Conduct Act* (the Act) has a specific definition of financial advice, and where advice is provided, there are a variety of regulatory obligations. 

It can be easy to discuss financial products and express opinions about them that might meet this definition. I want to have the option to say "stay away from that product", or "*I* wouldn't invest in that product, or recommend it to a friend or family member", rather than stay tight-lipped about it. 

It might also be the case that I'll want to talk favourably about one or more products, even if I fall short of making a definitive recommendation. I want to be able to recommend looking at, say, the Kernel and Simplicity High Growth KiwiSaver funds, and point out their respective benefits and differences, without having to perform linguistic gymnastics. 

There are exemptions for some situations where advice is given but it is ancillary to a specific other type of service (such as tax or legal advice), but these exemptions are unlikely to cover Fairhaven Wealth's services. 

Talking about financial products, whether they be investment products or insurance products, is not a core value proposition of Fairhaven Wealth's INSIGHT service. The INSIGHT service is about taking a bigger picture perspective, including whether and how financial products might fit into the bigger picture of your situation, and how you might think about them. However, some aspects of our discussion might technically fall within the regulatory definition of financial advice, and it's important that I satisfy all of the associated obligations, including being registered as an adviser and meeting the necessary disclosure requirements. 

## Is this an ongoing service? 
  
No. This is a one-off service. Fairhaven Wealth provides one-off services, not ongoing engagements.

Of course, we can have an ongoing relationship. I love to stay in touch with past clients! It is one of the most rewarding parts of the business. But that doesn't translate to an ongoing professional engagement, which results in you committing to pay Fairhaven Wealth on an ongoing basis.

It is important for me to point out that this is different from a lot of providers of financial services. Most engagements, particularly those provided by financial planners and investment advisers, are ongoing arrangements, which involve a commitment to provide ongoing services – not to mention, a commitment to pay ongoing fees.

For many people, ongoing service arrangements are appropriate and suitable. If you want or need an ongoing arrangement like this, then Fairhaven Wealth is not right for you. 

However, if you want to work on a one-off basis, and don't want to feel "locked" into an ongoing service – and fee – arrangement, then Fairhaven Wealth's service might be appropriate for you.

## Can I schedule reviews?

If you've engaged Fairhaven Wealth in the past, you can engage Fairhaven Wealth again. But that is entirely at your discretion, and is something you have to actively choose to do. 

As it stands, the cost of the review service is the same price as the standard service. However, you will have the option of having a single meeting rather than two meetings, and for this we will charge half the standard price (ie, $3,000 for a single three-hour meeting instead of $6,000 for two three-hour meetings). 

For a limited period of time, clients who engaged Fairhaven Wealth will have the option of paying half this amount – ie, $1,500 for a three-hour meeting or $3,000 for two three-hour meetings.

The cost and scope of review services are subject to change. 

## What about questions that arise after the engagement is complete?

I'm just an email or a phone call away. 

I don't charge for short follow-up conversations. In fact, I love to hear from past clients! It's rewarding, and receiving updates from past clients informs the discussions I have with other clients, so it's win-win!

I'll only charge for significant additional work. Where this is the case, we discuss this transparently and make it clear beforehand before any billable work begins. To date all clients have been satisfied with this. If anything I'm considered "too reasonable" when it comes to charging for follow-up work.

## What's included vs what's extra?

I provide the same service to everyone. There are no "added extras", unless you can come up with something creative you specifically want to engage me for, over and above my normal service.

## Isn't $6,000 for two three-hour conversations expensive? 

Yes. 

Well, it is for most people. Not for everyone.

And even if something is expensive, it can still be worth it. 

## Is the service worth $6,000?

For most people? No. 

For some people? Yes. 

Lots of things are expensive and not worth it for the majority of people. But they're worth it for some people. Cars and properties are good examples, but it also applies to services. 

If you think the service is expensive and you're unlikely to get that amount of value from our discussions, then it's a strong indication that this service isn't for you. 

One other thing worth noting is that many financial advisers charge in a less transparent manner, and you can end up paying *significantly* more than than $6,000. Many financial planners charge annual fees that are calculated as a percentage of the financial assets they are advising on and managing. If you have a portfolio of $1 million, and you are being charged 1% of your portfolio, this comes to around $10,000 per year. $2 million at 1% is $20,000, $4 million is $40,000, you get the picture. On top of this, you might also have to pay additional platform fees for them to provide this service (which they might receive, but is a cost related to the service). This can make $6,000 seem cheap!

To be clear, the service that these advisers provide is different to Fairhaven Wealth. They will be providing definitive advice, and are usually responsible for managing transactions on your behalf. This is valuable and important for many people. Many also charge less than 1% (particularly for those with larger portfolios). For some people, however – I believe that Fairhaven Wealth provides a lot of the genuine value that they would receive from these ongoing engagements, and possibly with lower risk and potential conflict of interest. (Lower risk because there is no third party that can touch your finances, and less conflicts of interest because Fairhaven Wealth's remuneration model isn't linked to a particular class of financial assets, which could potentially lead to a bias in favour of these assets.)

## Does the fact that Fairhaven Wealth charges so much, suck? 

Yeah, it kind of does. I have an egalitarian streak and I wish that I could provide this service more cheaply to more people. 

However, I'm one person, with a unique set of skills, a number of other competing priorities, and a limited number of hours in the day. That's what I'm prepared to work for. If people are prepared to engage me for the price I'm prepared to charge, that's the market at work. 

This FAQ isn't really the context for a long discussion on this topic. It's written for the small subset of Kiwis who are considering spending $6,000 on Fairhaven Wealth's services.

However, I will note that one way I try to make peace with this is that I have spent, and continue to spend, a lot of my time and energy on other projects that I hope will benefit other Kiwis more broadly. For example:

* I've written extensively and freely on my blog. I have taken a hiatus over the past couple of years but plan to return to this soon. I do not use the blog to directly make money (although it might indirectly attract some potential clients for Fairhaven Wealth). In particular, the blog does not advertise any third party products or services, so I can maintain independence and the ability to discuss topics without fear or favour, which can be more difficult to do when this might impact other income sources.

* When regulatory changes relating to financial services are proposed, I take steps to try to influence them so they are consumer-focused, rather than inordinately influenced by the financial services organisations that have more of a direct interest in them.  

* I am also working on other products and services that can be more broadly useful, such as Flawcastr, which I'm making free and open source.

## Can I get a similar service from other advisers for a smaller fee, or for free?

Maybe. You might even find people who provide a more comprehensive service for a lower price. 

If you find someone who does something similar, feel free to let me know, and I can pass their details on to people who make enquiries about Fairhaven Wealth and can't justify the price of Fairhaven Wealth's services.

One thing worth noting is that if you're paying less for a similar service, it's quite possible that the individual or organisation providing the service will be treating it as a loss-leader, on the basis that they will make money from you in other ways in the future. I don't do this. 

At the end of the day, the main distinguishing factor for this service is that you'll be working with me. In this document, and elsewhere, I've been very transparent about how I approach things. 

If you've seen how I think and operate, and want *my* unique perspective on your situation, rather than the perspective of someone else, then that's the cost.

## How do you get paid?

The only remuneration I receive is from clients. I'm the sole shareholder of Fairhaven Ventures Ltd and receive income in the form of drawings from the business. 

## What extra fees should I be aware of?

I charge a fixed fee, and that's it. There are no extra fees involved with my service. 

Conceivably, if the scope of the advice ended up being substantially larger than anticipated, it might be necessary to charge more. To date this hasn't happened. If this was the case I would communicate this clearly to you ahead of time and get agreement before proceeding.

If you make any decisions following your engagement with Fairhaven Wealth, there may be fees and costs associated with whatever decisions you make – such as management fees associated with managed funds, insurance premiums for insurance, or costs associated with more specialised professional advice. However, these costs are separate from the services provided by Fairhaven Wealth.

One of my key philosophies is try to help you pay as few unnecessary fees as possible.

## Have Fairhaven Wealth's clients been happy with the services historically?

Yes. 

You can look at dozens of testimonials provided by dozens of clients here. 

It's not really my place to say, but I believe that the clients I've worked with have found me engaging, trustworthy, and able to communicate my advice in a way that is clear and tailored to them. I work with all clients in a spirit of candour, transparency, and good faith.

## What about if I'm not satisfied with the service?

Fairhaven Wealth operates a "5-star payment policy". 

If you engage Fairhaven Wealth, the first $1,000 needs to be paid upfront, before the first conversation.

However, the remaining $5,000 is only payable after the second conversation. With this remaining $5,000, our expectation is that you will pay in accordance with how the service met your expectations.

If you believe you've received a 5 star service, in the sense that it fully met your expectations, then you pay the full $5,000. 

If, however, you would rate it as a 4-star service, then you only pay $4,000. 

A 3-star service, $3,000; 2-star $2,000; 1-star $1,000; 0-star $0. 

There are two reasons we do this:

* To provide prospective clients with confidence that they are not committing to an exorbitant amount of money if doesn't meet their expectations.

* To keep ourselves honest, and on our toes. In the world of professional services, it can be difficult to get a sense of whether clients are satisfied and their expectations are being met. If we tie the amount of money we receive directly to this, then we will actually receive this feedback and be better able to calibrate to client expectations.

Fairhaven Wealth is also a member of an alternative dispute resolution scheme. You can lodge complaints in the way described in the Fairhaven Wealth disclosure statement.

## What happens if I'm not satisfied with the service after the first session? 

You don't have to pay anything more than $1,000. It's your choice whether to have the follow-up conversation. 

## What about if I pay the initial $1,000 but have second thoughts before the first meeting?

If you give me notice of 24 hours, I will refund you in full. If you give notice of 12 hours, I will refund $500. 

## Do you touch my money? 

NO!!! 

I don't touch your money in any way, shape, or form.

## Are you a fiduciary?

If by asking whether I'm a fiduciary, you're really asking whether my interests are aligned with yours, and that I don't let any conflicts of interest stop me from providing a service that I think is in your best interests, then yes, I'm a fiduciary.

If you want a more technical answer, fiduciary relationships only exist in relationships of reliance and potential vulnerability. In that sense, our relationship doesn't have the same characteristics as, say, someone who is touching your money, so I'm arguably not a fiduciary. For many people I'd question whether entering into a relationship of such reliance and trust is necessary or desirable.

## What are your conflicts of interest?

Fairhaven Wealth has been structured so that conflicts of interest are *avoided*, rather than *managed.*

In this sense, Fairhaven Wealth doesn't have any substantive conflicts of interest that you might see with many financial service providers who focus on managing conflicts rather than avoiding them. 

There are no conflicts of interest relating to remuneration. All income received by Fairhaven Wealth is received directly from clients. No commission is received, and no money is received in an opaque way through third parties. 

Even income received by clients is received in a way where clients only pay the full amount if they are satisfied with the service and it meets their expectations. 

Fairhaven Wealth doesn't have any relationship with third parties that might influence it service.

Fairhaven Wealth's business model isn't predicated on encouraging you to invest via certain types of assets or purchase particular financial products. For example, Fairhaven Wealth receives no commission from any financial products (such as commission for insurance) nor generate income associated with certain types of assets (such as financial assets invested via a platform or wrap, on which a percentage-based fee might be charged). 

Fairhaven Wealth doesn't provide a service that involves the provision of advice, but even if I did, I don't believe there are conflicts of interest which would influence the actual advice I generated.

When I set up Fairhaven Wealth, I did it so I could follow what I call the "family and friends rule". That is, I would provide my clients with the same guidance  I'd provide to close friends and family members if they were in your position. In fact, I recommend what I would do if I were in your shoes.

But it's impossible to avoid all conflicts of interest!

Having said that, conflicts of interest always exist. 

All businesses have interests that are in conflict with their clients. 

(The same is true of all individuals. We all have interests that conflict with other people, including the people we love the most. Even people in committed long-term relationships need to make compromises for the sake of their partner and the relationship at times!)

In this sense, Fairhaven Wealth's biggest conflict of interest is that it charges fixed fees. 

Arguably, this creates an incentive for me to spend as little time as possible on the service. 

(As  opposed to if I charged hourly rates, which might create an incentive to spend more time than  necessary – "to mow the grass with scissors" so that I can charge more!) 

This conflicted is compounded by the fact that, all else being equal, I'd like to spend less time working on client-related matters and more time working on my personal projects. 

I have managed this a few different ways

* I charge a lot of money. I charge enough so that if I feel compelled to spend more time to satisfy a client, I feel okay doing so. 

* Fairhaven Wealth charges on the basis of a"5-star payment policy". This aligns my interests with those of my clients, in the sense that if I'm spending too little time and not meeting expectations, I won't be paid in full. 

* Offering one-off services also creates an incentive for me to provide high quality services, because I won't receive additional work from existing clients, or receive referrals, unless the service I provide is of sufficiently high quality. I believe this keeps me sharper compared to engaging clients with ongoing service arrangements. 

* One other subtle conflict of interest is that for most service providers, there's a tendency to CYA, or "cover your ass". Many advisers, for instance, have a tendency to be over-cautious because they don't want to expose clients to risk that might in turn expose them to risk. This is the case even if the clients might have a higher appetite for risk and be prepared to take on risk, in a fully informed manner. 

The best I can do is be up-front about this, mindful of it, communicate it, and do my best to ensure that conversations don't end up being a personal Rorschach test. 

## Do you have any *potential* conflicts of interest? 

This isn't currently relevant, but I sometimes wonder whether it will occur at some point in time.

I have an entrepreneurial spirit, and I can imagine a time where the opportunity and timing are right for me to pursue a venture that will require fundraising capital.

This will put me in an uncomfortable position. Based on my professional interactions with people via Fairhaven Wealth, I will have a decent idea of people who have the resources, and possibly the inclination, to fund whatever that venture might be. 

I am undecided what I will do when that is the case. My immediate inclination is to have a blanket policy where I rule out the possibility of taking funding from anyone who engages Fairhaven Wealth. On the face of it, this seems like the most simple approach. 

There's a good chance that this concern is redundant. There's as good chance I'd have personal relationships with people who have the resources and inclination to invest (ie, the "friends, family, and fools" network). And if the opportunity is sufficiently attractive, I should be able to get funding via more formal routes such as angel investment networks and venture capital – which itself would be a litmus test of the venture's feasibility. 

However. It might be that I know people for whom the venture is an ideal fit. It might be mutually beneficial to enter into some sort of arrangement with this person (or these people) – more so than anyone I know personally, and more so than more formal arrangements. 

If the opportunity is good, it feels like having a policy of refusing funding from previous Fairhaven Wealth clients is antagonistic to these clients, because it means they are being ruled out from opportunities that have the potential to be rewarding. 

Let's put it another way. Fairhaven Wealth's services aren't cheap. If you engage me and pay the full price – indicating that the service I provide met or exceeded your expectations – then that is something of a vote of confidence in my capabilities. After our engagement, you might *want* to have the option to be involved in any future venture I'm involved in. 

So. Contrary to my immediate instinct, my inclination is as follows. **If you engage Fairhaven Wealth, there is a chance that I might get in touch with an investment proposition in the future.** This will not constitute a recommendation. I will not make any propositions of this nature during any of our engagements: if I'm pursuing a project of this nature, then I will not be providing services via Fairhaven Wealth at the time. 

## Do you have referral arrangements that might influence the service you provide?

No. I don't have any formal referral arrangements with anyone. I don't receive, or pay, anything resembling a "finder's fee" for referrals. 

If I refer someone to another professional, the only reason I am making this referral is because I believe there is a good fit with the person and the service that professional is likely to provide. I don't receive anything in return from that professional for the referral – except the peace of mind of knowing that they won't embarrass me by providing a sub-standard service. 

Likewise, I don't pay other people for referring my services to other people. If someone refers Fairhaven Wealth, I want it to be for the right reasons, not because it will benefit the referrer. 

## Do you have any arrangements or special relationships with any financial product providers? 

No. I don't have any formal arrangements, or special commercial relationships, with any financial product providers.

There are definitely financial product providers that I prefer. For example, I have a soft spot for Simplicity and Kernel Wealth. This is because I like many of the products they issue, and I like Simplicity's structure. I have cultivated relationship with representatives of these organisations because of this. As happens when one has worked in an industry for a while, I have also developed professional and personal relationships with people across different organisations.

However, at a professional level, I keep a certain degree of distance from organisations and individuals. Beyond ensuring there aren't any commercial incentives for preferring one institution over others, I prioritise my independence, and my ability to criticise and question decisions that any organisation makes. 

Examples of where I have ensured this is the case:

* I was approached by one product issuer regarding whether I might be prepared to provide advice to some of its employees, with that issuer paying for the service as an employee benefit. I said that I wasn't comfortable with this arrangement because it might compromise my independence in a subtle way. 

* I have worked on some initiatives – particularly my Flawcastr project – that I believe could add value to Kiwis in relation to financial literacy, and would benefit from receiving funding to support its development. I believe this would be an ideal candidate for a grant from Simplicity Foundation. However, I have decided not to apply for funding because I believe this might compromise my independence.

On a related note, I do not have any direct equity stake in any companies or investments I discuss. I might have an indirect stake, in the sense that one of the managed funds I invest in might have an interest in a company that might have some stake in what you do. However, I invest exclusively via widely diversified, index-based funds, and do not have concentrated interests in any companies of this nature. This doesn't have any impact whatsoever in what I think or say or ask. 

## What about incentives that are *missing* from Fairhaven Wealth's business model? 

Fairhaven Wealth does not get involved with *implementing* anything you decide to do after our engagement. 

This was a conscious decision: it wouldn't be in a position where we felt we had to persuade you to go ahead with anything that we recommend to you. It's *your* money. It's *your* life. We can put you in a position where you can make more informed and confident decisions. However, it's *your* decision to make.

There is, however, one major downside. It means that we aren't incentivised to push and prod you to do what might be the best thing for you. I'm speaking for myself, but sometimes I need some external encouragement and accountability. I don't think I'm alone with this. 

Because of this, there is a risk that you might generate some insight and be inclined to make decisions and take action. However, you might be less likely to go ahead with that, since I don't have any incentive to push you. In this case, a more traditional engagement model might be a better fit for you. 

## Do you hold professional indemnity insurance?

No.

One of the major reasons is that I think there is an extremely high chance that if I had to make a claim, I wouldn't be covered anyway. This is because the services provided via Fairhaven Wealth are unique and don't fall within the standard set of services anticipated by the underwriting teams. 

Fairhaven Wealth is a single-person operation, and it's not worth my time or the time of a broker to work out a policy that is suitable for what I do and would be reasonably priced (from my perspective). 

On a related note, it probably wouldn't be worth suing Fairhven Wealth. The entity that provides any services, Fairhaven Ventures Ltd, has very few assets. To the extent you might try to sue me personally, my personal wealth has been settled into one or more trusts, where those assets are held for the benefit of other beneficiaries. 

I share this to be entirely transparent. 

## What types of clients do you specialise in? What does your ideal client look like?

Almost all of my clients to date have been "ideal" clients. They don't fit within a particular demographic. However, they seem to have three things in common

- they're switched on;
- they're engaged in their financial futures; and
- they're nice.

## Are there clients who aren't suitable for you?

Fairhaven Wealth's services aren't suitable for most people. For one thing, the price of Fairhaven Wealth's services are too high to justify for most households. 

Having said this, Fairhaven Wealth is not suitable for for you if

* you are looking for definitive advice relating to one or more financial products (investment, insurance, or otherwise);
* you are wanting someone to prepare a detailed financial plan for you;
* you're not engaged with your finances;
* you want to outsource your financial life to a third party;
* you're having issues dealing with debt and making ends meet (addressing those issues involve distinct skill sets);
* you want an adviser who wears expensive suits and ties and/or has their business name on the side of a CBD building;
* you think it's possible to "beat the market" and want someone who thinks they can do this for you;
* you think it's possible to "time the market" and want someone who thinks they can do this for you;
* you think it's possible to pick stocks that will outperform the market and want someone who thinks they can do this for you (... you probably get the idea);
* you want someone who will give you certainty about the future (the best I can give you is comfort and confidence in the face of an uncertain future);
* you want someone who uses technical terminology (aka "jargon") at any opportunity; or
* you want sympathy for supporting Donald Trump. I don't like that guy.

## What don't you do?

Fairhaven Wealth doesn't provide

* definitive recommendations in relation to financial products (in New Zealand or elsewhere);
* investment planning services;
* budgeting services;
* mortgage broking services;
* insurance product advice;
* legal advice; or
* accounting and tax advice.


## Are there any geographical limitations to your service? How do you handle international clients or time zone differences?

NZ only.

## How do you communicate with clients?

I communicate with clients in whatever way suits them. If you're in the Christchurch area, I'm usually happy to meet you at your home or office. 

Historically I have met a lot of clients at my home office. We are in the middle of major renovations so my home office isn't currently suitable for meetings. 

The majority of my clients are outside of Christchurch. Some clients has historically flown in to meet me. However, the vast majority of clients speak with me via telephone or Skype/Zoom and communicate via email. 

## Do you have any disclosures?

Yes. My primary disclosure statement can be found here. 

Frankly, I believe that the information in this FAQ expands on everything that needs to be set out in the disclosure document. 

## How do you protect client data and what are your privacy policies?


Fairhaven Wealth's privacy policy can be found here. The TL;DR is: your information is kept secure and not sold to anyone else. It is only shared with third parties where required by law or in a way in which it is necessary to provide high quality services. Fairhaven Wealth retains very limited client data – emails and documents which are stored digitally (physical documents are digitised and shredded or returned), on devices under our control and cloud services, where we have security measures in place (including two-factor authentication). 

## What's your succession plan?

I provide one-off engagements. If you want to re-engage me but something has happened to me in the meantime, you'll need to find another adviser. If something happens to me in the middle of the engagement I won't be able to complete the engagement. You won't be invoiced for the service. The only cost to you will be the time you have put into our discussions and the inconvenience of having to find another service provider. 

## Do you work with clients who already have advisers?

Yes. 

A number of my clients already have relationships with advisers and engage me for a fresh perspective in relation to their financial affairs. 

Because I provide an advice-only service, you can engage me and this won't interrupt your current engagement with your existing adviser at all.

## How many clients do you work with?

Since establishing Fairhaven Wealth in 2016 I've worked with over one hundred clients. However, as I provided clients on an as-needed basis, I wouldn't consider any of these to be ongoing clients. 

One of the reasons I have priced Fairhaven Wealth's services at their current level is so that at any one time, I am only ever working with a very small number of clients at one time. 

I have priced and positioned this service so that at any given moment, I won't be working with more than one or two sets of clients, and no more than 20 clients per year. 

## Do you have a set account minimum?

No. 

Admittedly, the amount I charge tends to select for people with a decent amount of assets. However, I don't have a minimum whatsoever. 

## What do I need to do before our meetings?

I don't prescribe any preparation, or require you to provide any information to me ahead of the meeting. I don't give you any forms or checklists. 

Prepare as much or as little as you like, in whatever way you like.

If you like, you can provide information ahead of time (eg via email). Or you can have it to hand at the time of our first meeting, and use that to help set the agenda for our conversations. Or you can just turn up to the meeting with your good, candid self, and I'll start asking questions.

You know your situation better than me, and I trust you to know if there is any especially important information that you need to provide. I also trust that you can answer each of my questions as we go through the conversation. 

If you share any information, I prefer see it in the way that *you* record and process it, which will help me understand even better where you're coming from. This is one of the reasons I don't provide you with any forms or checklists: I don't want to create any filters that might homogenise the way you think about things.

Many clients have historically provided nothing before the first meeting. 

Some clients have provided lots of information and detail beforehand – balance sheets, budgets, schedules of assets and insurance, trust deeds, tax returns, documents setting out what they want to achieve, etc. Many of these clients find these meetings to be a good "forcing function" for them to collate everything and put things in writing in their own way.

If, after the first conversation, it seems like there is additional information that would be valuable, I'll let you know – either during the conversation or in a follow-up email. If there are any exercises or things that I recommend you reflect on between the first and second meeting, I will let you know. 

I find that in the course of my conversations with clients, I'm able to elicit more than enough information to generate significant insight. 

The most important thing to bring to a our conversations is your good, candid self. 

## What do we cover in our conversations? What sorts of questions do you ask?****

I try to keep my conversations as free-wheeling and natural as possible. 

The first thing I will always do is ask if there is anything you want to put on the table, to make sure we cover in our conversation. There might be something specific that you have in mind, such as a particular decision, or a particular area you want to focus on. I will make sure that this is covered in our conversation, and do everything I can to tie everything together.

However, I will ask you lots of general, and seemingly basic stuff. Like your ages, as well as ages, names, and information about your family. I will ask questions about your personal and professional life. 

We will spend a lot of time on the "soft stuff". I'll ask about your thoughts and feelings on lots of stuff. I will ask you to clarify things that aren't clear or that seem inconsistent with other things you've said. At times, I will push back and challenge you on what you have to say (ie, act as a "Devil's Avocado" – a friendly version of a Devil's Advocate). 

I'll try to ask the same basic questions in lots of different ways. I'll ask explicitly what you want to achieve, financially and otherwise. I'll ask you want you *don't* want to happen. I'll run hypothetical scenarios past you to get an idea of how you might respond. 

I will encourage you to go on tangents, and topics that don't seem immediately relevant. That is often where really important and valuable stuff comes up. 

At times, it might seem like we are veering into territory that doesn't seem directly relevant to your main concern or area you want to focus on. However, this is deliberate. 

One of the most important aspects of this service is to ensure that we contextualise this concern or area within the bigger picture of your life. This means that we can step back, and in a sense, allows me to "question the question". 

There are many times, for instance, when a particular concern we have, is not the *actual* concern, and there other elements at play.

There are also many times where we can be fixated on one thing, when there are more important things that we need to focus on. Or things we simply hadn't thought of. 

Even if you are focused on one particular thing, then it's valuable and important to understand it from many different angles. I'm not sure about you, but there's nothing more annoying than someone making suggestions, or asking inane questions – even with the best of intentions – about something you've given a lot of thought to, without understanding the broader context of what you've done, what you've thought about, and how it fits with other parts of your life.  

At various points in the conversation, I will ask if there is anything that you want to touch on, or expand on, and try to explicitly understand and calibrate to your experience of the conversation. 

At a very high level, I will ask about:

* Your family situation. This might include children and grandchildren. But it will expand to other family members, as this can provide insight into things like health/longevity, and may have financial considerations. It will also expand to people in your orbit who might become dependent (financially or otherwise) on you in the future. 

* I'll ask a variety of questions about your professional life. I'll ask about opportunities and risks, in your current position, and more broadly. 

* I'll ask lots of questions and run you through various hypotheticals, in large part to get a sense of your values and priorities. For example

	* What would you do differently if money wasn’t an issue?
	
	* What would you do if you found out you only had five or ten good years of life left?
	
	* What are some _worst case_ scenarios that you’d rather not entertain? (Because it’s one thing to focus on what you _want_ to happen. It’s also important to manage the risks associated with what you _don’t_ want to happen.)
	
	* I ask questions to get an insight into their psychological tolerance for risk. I ask questions like what you’d see in an online risk tolerance questionnaire (like [here](https://sorted.org.nz/tools/investor-kickstarter)). But I ask questions in a more open-ended way. For example, I usually ask:
	
		* When it comes to investing, what does “risk” mean to you?
		
		* How would you characterise your tolerance for risk, compared to other people at your age and stage?
		
		* How would you describe your experience with investing?

		These questions don’t lend themselves to multiple-question answers. They lead to _discussions_, which reveal nuances and complexities that “yes”, “no”, or “maybe” responses can’t match.

I will probably work through some "flawcasting" in relation to your financial situation. Specifically, we will consider a number of assumptions/variables that you are making (either explicitly or implicitly to date!) and see how these translate into your long-term financial situation. As part of this, we will investigate the strength of your assumptions, and look at different types of scenarios. (I use the term "flawcasting" instead of forecasting, because the only guarantee someone can give about a long-term forecast is that it will be wrong!)

When it comes to specific goals and objectives, I will ask questions about how you prioritise them, if and when you need to make trade-offs. For example, how would you personally balance working less, retiring earlier, trying something different professionally, having more money in retirement, spending more on day-to-day lifestyle and/or capital items (eg baches), and being more generous with loved ones and causes you care about. 

As we speak, I will take notes. I also have a document that I use that helps me to make sure that I don't miss any important topics and that might prompt me to go into more detail. However, the conversation tends to be very organic. 

## What specific financial topics or areas do you typically cover in your conversations?

It depends. 

One of the reasons I've shifted from a more financial-oriented business model to this more general model is because I don't want the service to be constrained to simply discussing financial assets. 

Very often, clients would start their engagement thinking that there concern was working out how to invest in financial assets, when it became clear that there were other matters that were more important (even in terms of financial import). In other cases, the solution didn't really relate to financial assets, and related to other types of investments, or to professional decisions (ie, how they use their human capital – which for many people, is the most valuable asset they have, even if it doesn't show up on a conventional balance sheet). 

A big part of our conversations revolves around determining what specifically to focus on. I don't want to start the engagement with a myopic focus on financial topics. However, *if* there are specific financial topics that are important to cover, we will do that. 

Do I have a deep understanding of every financial asset and product out there? No. No one does.

Do you want to discuss an individual, publicly listed company, and its future prospects? I'm probably not going to add any value. I believe in a version of the efficient market hypothesis in relation to these sorts of investments – the market for these investments may not be efficient, but they inefficient in ways that we can't predict, so we might as well treat them as efficient, and accept that the market price for investments in these assets reflect all available information.

A particular investment offering, whether that be a managed investment scheme directed towards retail clients, or even wholesale clients? I can look into it. My legal background (which has included preparing and updating Product Disclosure Statements, and underlying documents (such as trust deeds) for these sorts of products), informed by my time as a financial planner, has equipped me well for this. 

Insurance? I can speak in very general terms in relation to personal insurance – such as life insurance, income and mortgage protection insurance, trauma/critical illness insurance, and total and permanent disability insurance. I can talk, generally, about health insurance, and also in relation to some general insurance products (but with less granularity). I do *not* provide advice about specific insurance products: I would suggest you speak to a product specialist about this (and am happy to refer you to someone if necessary). However, I can speak about these sorts of products within the broader context of your situation, particularly in terms of what you want to achieve – and *don't* want to happen. 

Lending? This isn't something I really touch, except in the context of your broader situation.

Over time, the main thing I've found is that the true value with financial planning doesn't relate to the specific underlying financial assets. It's about how they work together, at a holistic, big picture level. It relates to your overall asset allocation – how your assets are spread across different types of investments across the entire range of your investments, whether that be KiwiSaver, investments in one or more managed funds, investments in publicly listed shares, investments in private companies, investments in real estate, and the like. 

I can, and am prepared to, discuss a number of financial topics at a granular level. However, I am reluctant to do that without a solid grounding of how that topic fits within your broader situation. 

## When it comes to money, what are some of your biases and prejudices? 

I have biases and prejudices. I'm human: we all have 'em.

In terms of personal finance, my general belief is that the simpler you can keep your financial affairs, the better. A good goal is to make your financial life boring, so you can make the rest of your life interesting. 

My bias is that it's impossible to have a one-size-fits-all approach to your finances (or life in general): we are all different, and our plans should be different. What works for your friend, family member, colleague, or neighbour may work for them. But that doesn't mean it'll work for you – because we're all unique people, with our own idiosyncratic circumstances, needs, and objectives.

My bias is to be distrustful of advice influenced strongly by conflicts of interest. I subscribe to the view of "show me the incentives and I'll show you the outcomes". 

In general, I believe insurance is a wonder of the modern world – similar to vaccines. Insurance is a mechanism for sharing risk with other people. Insurance companies facilitate these arrangements, and make a profit in doing so, but *someone* has to do it. I don't envy their role in trying to assess and price risk, and making sure that payouts are only made in appropriate cases, and I'm grateful that they exist to do this. Having said that, I am mindful that many people are over-insured, paying premiums to manage risks that are no longer relevant to them. 

I also think that many of our biggest financial risks can't be insured against. These include professional risks (such as being displaced from the workforce) and risks associated with relationship break-downs. 

In terms of investing, I have my own "inefficient market hypothesis" – which is that most investments are in inefficient markets. However, in some markets, the market is inefficient in ways that we can't predict, so we might as well treat it as efficient. This is particularly the case with publicly listed shares, where I have a bias towards investing in "passive" index-based funds. Instead of trying to beat the market, you should make sure that you don't get beaten by the market. 

Other markets, however, are inefficient, and "active" investment might be appropriate. This relates to property investment, investing in personal ventures, and even in terms of investing in human capital. 

I have a bias towards thinking of "wealth" beyond financial terms. I often speak in terms of people investing in their health and in their relationships, because I genuinely believe that these are fundamental to a living a rich life. 

Related to this, I have a slight bias towards people decumulating capital over the course of their retirement rather than "living off the interest" or "the interest of the interest". There might be situations where this is appropriate, but it is often an indicator that people are prioritising money over other aspects of life. 

Having said all of the above, I believe there is room for genuine good faith debate about all of these things, and I also appreciate that people can legitimately weigh different things in different ways. 

Ultimately, I'm biased towards recognising that I'm not the final authority on anything (even aspects of my own life!). I urge my clients to push back and challenge me on anything I say. I encourage people to "question the question". 

I believe that _you_ are the final authority of or your own life.


## How is your own money invested?**

I have money invested in Australian superannuation in a low-fee, widely diversified, growth-oriented fund. My KiwiSaver is invested in Kernel's High Growth fund (and my wife's Kiwisaver is invested in Simplicity's Growth Fund). I have funds invested in SuperLife's conservative fund. The majority of my surplus income is directed towards repaying my mortgage. Investing time and money into this my own career (including this business) and the career of my wife also involves significant investment.

I have a number of insurances in place, including home, contents, car, professional indemnity, life, trauma/critical illness, income protection, and total and permanent disability (TPD) insurance.

If you're interested, in late 2019 I wrote a detailed article on ["How I money"](https://wealthandrisk.nz/how-i-money/).

## How do you measure success?

In the context of Fairhaven Wealth, I track success by the satisfaction of my clients. 

I ask clients whether my service covered everything they wanted it to cover. I encourage clients to push back and challenge anything that they don't agree with or that doesn't resonate with them. 

From my perspective, I'm successful if I've helped clients cultivate an understanding of their situation, so that they can make confident decisions that are aligned with their values and priorities. 

I'm successful if, after working with me, they feel more comfortable and confident about their financial futures.

The [kind words of my clients](https://fairhavenwealth.co.nz/testimonial) are a good barometer of my success in relation to the advice I provide.

## On a more personal (and selfish) note

Although it's important that I generate an income from Fairhaven Wealth, I've also created this business so I can have flexibility with my time, so I can spend time with family and focus on other projects. 

For me, success is also about being able to speak without fear or favour, and living with integrity in line with my values and beliefs. 

Ultimately, success (and true wealth) for me is more about maintaining good health and good relationships than maximising the size of my balance sheet.

## What do you love about your job

I love getting to know my clients. It is a pleasure and a privilege to have candid conversations and be worthy of the trust that people place in me. I love helping to develop plans with clients to help them live a life that's in line with their values and priorities. I love giving clients a sense of comfort and confidence about their financial futures – and their lives in general.

## What ethical framework guides your practice? 

I believe grappling earnestly with ethical questions is part of living a meaningful life, and it's important to ensure that the frameworks we apply personally are in line with how we act professionally.

While I don't claim to have all the answers, I'm committed to the ongoing journey of trying to do what's right. I have enormous respect for those who think critically about these issues. I appreciate that there is a great deal of room for good faith argument, and that people can legitimately weigh different criteria more heavily than others.

My approach isn't based on a single ethical framework, but draws from various philosophical traditions and practical considerations. While I'm influenced by utilitarianism and its focus on outcomes, I'm inclined to paraphrase Robert Downey Junior's character in *Tropic Thunder* – "you never go full utilitarian." If we could wrestle fully with uncertainty and have complete visibility of the long-term consequences of our actions, I would probably err that way, or to some version of rule utilitarianism. However, that's not the case, so I try to apply ethical rules to my life – personal imperatives, if you will.

These philosophical considerations directly inform how I've structured Fairhaven Wealth:

1. Honesty and transparency is paramount. I'm upfront about my business model, limitations, and potential conflicts of interest. I'm also honest about what I don't know, and will say so.

2. I believe in [situational ethics](https://wealthandrisk.nz/situational-ethics/) – that in practice, our ethical decisions are heavily influenced by context, and the immediate pressures and incentives at play. This informs how I've structured Fairhaven Wealth, so that my interests are aligned as closely as possible with the interests of clients.

3. My service aims to help clients clarify their own values and make decisions aligned with those values, rather than imposing my views. I work hard to ensure that our conversations don't end up being a complex Rorschach test. 

I'm always open to examining and updating my ethical stances, and I encourage the same of others.

Some articles from my blog that expand on these topics include:

* [The minefield of ethical investing](https://wealthandrisk.nz/ethical-investing/)
* [Ethical consumption: staring at the sun](https://wealthandrisk.nz/ethical-consumption/)
* [Fiduciaries: yet another "F" word](https://wealthandrisk.nz/fiduciary/)

## What are your qualifications? 

I've met all the educational requirements necessary to be authorised to provide comprehensive financial advice.

I also have a Bachelor of Laws (LLB), a Bachelor of Commerce (BCom) (economics and finance), a Masters of Entrepreneurship degree, a Diploma in Financial Planning, and a Graduate Certificate in Professional Coaching. 

As a lawyer I've provided trust and estate planning services to many clients. I've also worked for many years as a financial services lawyer, when worked with banks, insurance companies, managed funds, and many financial advice businesses. In this capacity I've reviewed thousands of advice files prepared by hundreds of advisers and spoken with dozens of advisers in depth about their business and advice processes.

## How do you maintain your competence, knowledge, and skill relevant to the services you offer?

*(For reference: Part 2 of the [Code of Professional Conduct for Financial Services](https://financialadvicecode.govt.nz/) (the Code) sets out competence, knowledge, and skill requirements for people who are authorised to provide financial advice. This includes standards that require people to have general competence, knowledge, and skill in the first place – and to undertake continuing professional development to maintain this competence, knowledge, and skill, including retaining an update-to-date understanding of the relevant regulatory frameworks for providing advice. Specifically, Standard 6 of the Code requires people to, "at least annually, plan for and progressively complete learning activities to ensure they maintain" these competencies, knowledge, and skills. My response addresses this specifically, but is relevant more broadly.)* 

I maintain my competence, knowledge, and skill through several key approaches:

1. Continuous Learning:
	   
	- I read, listen to, and watch a wide range of resources relating to personal finance. I strive to be "promiscuous" in terms of where I source information to get as many different perspectives as possible.
    
	- I pay special attention to regulatory changes. When there are changes that I feel strongly about, I make submissions in relation to them.
    
	- Historically, I have used my blog, [Wealth & Risk](www.wealthandrisk.nz), as a context for putting my ideas in writing, working out what I actually think, and developing the ability to communicate it.

2. Professional Engagement:

	- I've been a member of Financial Advice New Zealand (FANZ), where I served on the Risk Member Advisory Committee (and was actively involved in advocating for FANZ members in relation to proposed regulatory changes) and was a founding member of the Canterbury region committee.
    
	- I've previously been a member of the New Zealand Law Society, where I was a founding member of an Elder Law Special Interest Group. I've also held memberships with the New Zealand Institute of Directors and the Governance Institute of Australia.

	- I'm not currently a member of any professional organizations, as I haven't found them relevant to my current needs.

3. Practical Experience:
	   
	- Working directly with clients has been one of the most valuable ways of maintaining my competency. In-depth conversations with thoughtful clients who ask valuable questions have been particularly beneficial.
	
    - Even during periods when I'm not actively advising, I maintain informal discussions with peers and previous clients, which serves as a practical test of my ongoing competence.

4. Recent Focus and Return to Practice:
    - In the past two years, I have spent less time keeping up to date with financial advising specifically. During this time, I wasn't assisting clients and was unsure if I would return to this type of work.
	
    - However, prior to reestablishing my practice, I have spent a significant amount of time updating my competencies in different, complementing domains.
	
    - I've also spoken with several previous clients in an informal capacity and have been encouraged to find I can still have valuable conversations. This served as a litmus test for whether I'd maintained my competencies.

I maintain a comprehensive understanding of the field, combining theoretical knowledge with practical experience and a commitment to ongoing professional development.

## Is there any other way of finding out your view on things? 

To get a sense of how I see the world, I encourage you to look at my blog, [Wealth & Risk](www.wealthandrisk.nz), where I published articles regularly for approximately 10 years. One of the reasons for writing publicly was to develop my thinking about a lot of topics, my ability to communicate ideas as I returned to them, and get the benefit of making my ideas legible and open to scrutiny.

## Please look at other service providers before deciding to engage Fairhaven Wealth

This isn't a question but an exhortation. 

If you've got this far, then there's a good chance that you like what you've read and it might be worth touching base to see whether Fairhaven Wealth can assist you.

However, I want to reiterate 

* Fairhaven Wealth's services are not for everyone, and they might not be for you.

* Fairhaven Wealth's services are different from what you are likely to find anywhere else. 

* At a personal level, I might be on your wavelength, but I also might not be. 

It's important that you find a service that is a fit for you, in terms of what you want and need. 

It's also important that you work with someone who is on your wavelength, with whom you can be entirely frank and candid about your situation, what you want and don't want, and who is able to challenge you.
