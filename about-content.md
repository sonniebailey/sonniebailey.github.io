## Executive summary

Fairhaven Wealth provides financial advice-related services to New Zealanders. Fairhaven Wealth charges $350 per hour, or offers a fixed-fee service for $5,000 (including GST). Our engagements are one-off, short-term, and we typically work with very few clients at any point in time.

When you deal with Fairhaven Wealth, you deal with Sonnie Bailey. You may be familiar with my writing on the [NZ Wealth & Risk blog](https:\\www.wealthandrisk.nz), where I published regularly for over 10 years.

I'm based in Christchurch but work with Kiwis throughout the country via Zoom, phone, and email.

I provided services to many clients through Fairhaven Wealth between 2017 and 2023, but recently took time off to focus on my family. After this hiatus, I am offering services via Fairhaven Wealth again, in a slightly different capacity.

For one thing, I have committed to short-term engagements with clients, and my intention is to only work actively with one or two clients at a time. Only once I've finished working with a client will I be open to working with another.

I operate Fairhaven Wealth in a fiercely independent manner and do everything I can to align my interests with those of my clients.

Fairhaven Wealth's primary service is a fixed-fee service for $5,000 including GST. This service consists of at least two three-hour conversations, usually held via Zoom or phone, and one or more emails touching on the content of these conversations. Having said this, you are only required to pay the full $5,000 if the service meets or exceeds your expectations. Your minimum commitment is $1,000, paid before the first meeting. Whether you pay more than this, and how much, depends on how you rate the the service on a 5-star basis. You only pay the full $5,000 if the service is a 5-star service. No strings attached.

You can also engage Fairhaven Wealth on an ad-hoc, hourly-rate basis, of $350 per hour.

I operate Fairhaven Wealth in a way so that I don't touch your money in any way, shape, or form. It's up to you whether or not to make any changes to your financial situation (or life in general) as a result of our discussions. It's up to you to implement any advice I might provide. 

You can engage us again in the future, but that's up to you. We aren't looking to engage in an relationship that will involve regular, ongoing fees.

Fairhaven Wealth's service is terrific for some people, but not appropriate for most people. It's best suited for people who already have a good understanding of their situation and are (or want to be) engaged in their finances. It also tends to be most valuable for those with some degree of financial and/or professional security.

Fairhaven Wealth has had many happy clients You can read dozens of testimonials [here](www.fairhavenwealth.co.nz/testimonials).

## Fairhaven Wealth's $5,000 "5-star" service

Fairhaven Wealth's primary service consists of two three-hour discussions, within approximately one week of each other. These meetings are followed by one or more emails, supporting these conversations and providing a high-level overview of what we discussed during each of the meetings.

$5,000 including GST, assuming the service meets or exceeds your expectations.

The minimum cost is $1,000. You pay this before the first meeting. You only pay more if you rate the service to be a 2-star service or higher, with the amount you pay being linked to how valuable you found it, as set out in the table below.

#### Why do I charge this way?

I charge this way for two main reasons:

* To provide you with confidence that you're not committing to paying $5,000 if the service doesn't meet your expectations.

* To keep me on my toes. In the world of professional services, it can be difficult to get a sense of whether clients are satisfied and their expectations are being met. If I tie the amount of money I receive directly to this, then there's no avoiding this feedback. 

#### Is $5,000 expensive? 

Yes. For most people. 

Is the service *worth* $5,000 for *most* people? No. 

Is the service worth $5,000 for *some* people? Yes. 

Is it expensive relative to how many financial planners charge? For many people, it's *cheap*.

Many financial planners charge clients for ongoing services as a percentage of "assets under advice". This usually comes out from the clients' investment portfolio, which the adviser manages, and can be a little opaque in the sense that you may not easily notice what you are paying. If you are investing $1 million or more with the help of a financial planner, there's a good chance that you are already paying more than $5,000 per year for their services. If you have a portfolio of significantly more than this, then $5,000 is probably a fraction of what you are paying. 

To be clear, Fairhaven Wealth's services are more limited in scope than the services that most financial planners provide. They are offering an ongoing service, and they are managing transactions and providing reporting on your behalf. These services are valuable and important for many people. However, for some people, I believe that Fairhaven Wealth provides a lot of the genuine value that they would receive from these ongoing engagements, and possibly with lower risk and potential conflict of interest. (Lower risk because there is no third party that can touch your finances; and less conflicts of interest because Fairhaven Wealth's remuneration model isn't linked to a particular class of financial assets, which could potentially lead to a bias in favour of investing these types of assets, or even a bias against spending or giving money away, when this might be appropriate.)

### What will I get out of this service? 

In a sense, my first question to you will be what you want to get out of the service!! It will depend on your current circumstances, needs, and objectives. 

You might, for instance, want me to do something that resembles a holistic review of your situation, and get fresh insights, identifying areas that might require your attention, suggesting what you could do ("you don't know what you don't know!"). Alternatively, you might have a high-stakes decision that you want to make, and want to focus the engagement on that (although I will still insist on considering this decision within the broader context of your situation). 

One way of getting an idea of what you might get from the service is by reading directly from client on the testimonials page of this site [here](www.fairhavenwealth.co.nz/testimonials). 

Examples of ways I've helped clients:

* For many clients, I've helped them realised that they're investing far too conservatively than necessary – and in doing so, are taking on risks that they have been overlooking – of being significantly worse-off over the long-run, by being too focused on short-term fluctuations. As a result of these conversations, they have been able to align their investment decisions more closely with their actual risk profile, and become comfortable with doing so.

* Several clients have been entertaining investments that were far riskier than they appreciated, after I pointed out various aspects of the investments. Often this also involved noting that these invesmtents they weren't actually aligned with their goals and priorities in life. There have been instances where clients have avoided significant losses and hassle as a result of this. 

* Many clients have become much more comfortable and confident in their financial situation in general. The type of people who engage Fairhaven Wealth aren't representative of the general population, in the sense that they tend to be in a comfortable financial position. However, I have been able to translate this intellectual undersetanding into a deeper, more felt sense, that *they will be just fine*. It means they can worry less about the money part of their lives and focus on enjoying other aspects of their journey through life.

* Many clients have come away from engagements with a much better understanding of insurance, and confidence that they are not paying too much or too less in premiums. 

* Many clients with their own businesses have realised that there is value in investing more into their business – among other reasons, to manage key-person risk, prepare the business for succession (increasing its value, or turning it into an asset), and free up time to focus on other things. 

* Several clients have subsequently chosen to take "sabbaticals" from their current professional life, to do something that is more personally rewarding, that might provide more valuable to the world, or that might be more financial beneficial over the longer run even if there may be short-term costs or risks.

* Some clients have more thoughtfully reflected on their plans for the next generation. Some have decided to "give with a warm hand rather than a cold hand" (ie, be more generous during their lifetimes). Others have realised that they have to be more careful about how they assist family members. It has prompted some to think more deeply about how to prepare their loved ones to be greater stewards of their eventual inheritance. Some have thought about different ways to assist their loved ones – for example, by more actively assisting with education costs for grandchildren, or even assisting with insurance premiums (since for many clients and trustees, the insurable risks of their loved ones can often become their own risks, and the risks of other loved ones/beneficiaries). 

* Some clients have thought more concretely about the strategy for giving to causes they care about, including aligning their giving with the true values and beliefs, and focusing more on effectiveness than "fuzzies".

#### What do I need to do before our conversations?

The most important thing to bring to our conversations is your good, candid self. 

I don't give you any forms or checklists. I don't prescribe that you do anything or provide me anything in advance or our initial meeting.  

Prepare as much or as little as you like, in whatever way you like.

If you like, you can provide information ahead of time (eg via email). Or you can have it to hand at the time of our first meeting, and use that to help set the agenda for our conversations. Or you can just turn up to the meeting with your good, candid self, and I'll start asking questions.

If you share any information, I prefer see it in the way that *you* record and process it, which will help me understand even better where you're coming from. This is one of the reasons I don't provide you with any forms or checklists: I don't want to create any filters that might homogenise the way you think about things.

Many clients have historically provided nothing before the first meeting. Some clients have provided lots of information and detail beforehand – balance sheets, budgets, schedules of assets and insurance, trust deeds, tax returns, documents setting out what they want to achieve, etc. Many of these clients find these meetings to be a good "forcing function" for them to collate everything and put things in writing in their own way.

If, after the first conversation, it seems like there is additional information that would be valuable, I'll let you know – either during the conversation or in a follow-up email. If there are any exercises or things that I recommend you reflect on between the first and second meeting, I will let you know. 

===

#### What specific financial topics or areas do you typically cover in your conversations?

It depends. 

One of the reasons I've shifted from a more financial-oriented business model to this more general model is because I don't want the service to be constrained to simply discussing financial assets. 

Historically, clients would often start our engagement thinking that their concern was working out how to invest in financial assets, when it became clear that there were other matters that were more important (even in terms of financial significance). For example, decisions relating to their professional lives or lifestyles.  

A big part of our conversations revolves around determining what specifically to focus on. I don't want to start the engagement with a myopic focus on financial topics. However, *if* there are specific financial topics that are important to cover, we will do that. 

Do I have a deep understanding of every financial asset and product out there? No. No one does.

Do you want to discuss an individual, publicly listed company, and its future prospects? I'm probably not going to add any value. I believe in a version of the efficient market hypothesis in relation to these sorts of investments – the market for these investments may not be efficient, but they inefficient in ways that we can't predict, so we might as well treat them as efficient, and accept that the market price for investments in these assets reflect all available information.

A particular investment offering, whether that be a managed investment scheme directed towards retail clients, or even wholesale clients? I can look into it. My legal background (which has included working directly for a fund manager, and also preparing and updating Product Disclosure Statements (PDSs), and underlying documents (such as trust deeds) for these sorts of products), informed by my time as a financial planner, has equipped me well for this. 

Insurance? I can speak in general terms in relation to personal insurance – such as life insurance, income and mortgage protection insurance, trauma/critical illness insurance, and total and permanent disability insurance. I can talk, generally, about health insurance, and also in relation to some general insurance products (but with less granularity). I do *not* provide advice about specific insurance products: I would suggest you speak to a product specialist about this (and am happy to refer you to someone if necessary). However, I can speak about these sorts of products within the broader context of your situation, particularly in terms of what you want to achieve – and *don't* want to happen. I can also speak generally about the level of cover that might be appropriate for you, and why.

Lending? This isn't something I don't really touch, except in the context of your broader situation (for example, whether additional lending would be appropriate or not).

Over time, the main thing I've found is that the true value with financial planning doesn't relate to the specific underlying financial assets. It's about how they work together, at a holistic, big picture level. To the extent it relates to investment assets, it relates to your overall asset allocation – that is, how your assets are spread across different types of investments across the entire range of your investments, whether that be KiwiSaver, investments in one or more managed funds, investments in publicly listed shares, investments in private companies, investments in real estate, and the like. 

I can, and am prepared to, discuss a number of financial topics at a granular level. However, I am reluctant to do that without a solid grounding of how that topic fits within your broader situation. 

===

### Will I receive a comprehensive, documented financial plan?

No. I won't commit to this, because what is appropriate for any given engagement will depend on your situation and what you need. 

At the end of our engagement, you'll receive one or more emails that will summarise the key things we discussed. This will include any advice that we provide, including reasons and risks associated with that advice. 

The litimus test for whether the outcome from the engagement (documented or otherwise) is successful will be whether you are prepared to pay the full price for the service. If what you end up with isn't satisfactory, you can simply tell me, and I can address that in order to meet your expectations, or you can pay me less. 

## Ad hoc services ($350 per hour)

If you would prefer to engage Fairhaven Wealth for less structured, ad hoc services, then we will charge $350 per hour (including GST).

I recommend engaging Fairhaven Wealth for the fixed-fee service for first-time clients. For previous clients, ad hoc services are likely to be appropirate unless your circumstances have changed significantly and/or you want a more comprehensive set of discussions.

## Fairhaven Wealth doesn't lock you into ongoing service arrangements

I love having ongoing relationships with clients. I love staying in touch with past clients and finding out how they are going after we've worked together. It is one of the most rewarding parts of what I do. I now count many of my former clients as friends.

But that doesn't translate to an ongoing service engagement, which results in you committing to pay Fairhaven Wealth on an ongoing basis.

In this sense, Fairhaven Wealth only provides one-off services. You can engage Fairhaven Wealth again in the future, but the onus is on you to make that decision and re-engage.

This is fundamentally different from a lot of financial adviesrs. Most engagements, are ongoing arrangements, which involve the adviser committing to provide ongoing services – not to mention, a commitment on you to pay ongoing fees.

For many people, ongoing service arrangements are appropriate and suitable. If you want or need an ongoing arrangement like this, then Fairhaven Wealth will not be right for you. 

However, if you want to work on a one-off basis, and don't want to feel "locked" into an ongoing service – and fee – arrangement, then Fairhaven Wealth's service might be appropriate for you.

#### What about questions afterwards? Can I schedule reviews?

If you have questions that arise after the engagement is complete, I'm just an email or a phone call away. 

I don't charge for short follow-up conversations. In fact, I love to hear from past clients! It's rewarding, and receiving updates from past clients informs the discussions I have with other clients! It's win-win!

I'll only charge for significant additional work. Where this is the case, we discuss this transparently and make it clear beforehand before any billable work begins. To date all clients have been satisfied with this. If anything I'm considered "too reasonable" when it comes to charging for follow-up work.

For a limited period of time, clients who engaged Fairhaven Wealth prior to 2024 will have the option of paying half of the price of Fairhaven Wealth's current services - $2,500 for the 5-star service ($500 minimum spend, $500 for each star), or $175 per hour. 

## What doesn't Fairhaven Wealth do? 

Fairhaven Wealth doesn't: 

* provide legal advice, account or tax advice, budgeting services, mortgage broking services, or insurance product advice;

* help you if you're having issues with dealing with debt and making ends meet;

* try to "beat the market" or "time the market";

* talk with certainty about what the future holds; or

* touch your money and implement their recommendations on your behalf.

## About me – Sonnie Bailey

When you work with Fairhaven Wealth, you work with me – Sonnie Bailey. I don't have any employees and don't plan on employing anyone.

Throughout this document, I've written in the first person. However, all services provided by Fairhaven Wealth are provided via Fairhaven Ventures Ltd. I am the sole director and shareholder of this company. 

To get a sense of how I see the world, I encourage you to look at my blog, [Wealth & Risk](www.wealthandrisk.nz), where I published articles regularly for approximately 10 years. One of the reasons for writing publicly was to develop my thinking about a lot of topics, my ability to communicate these ideas, and get the benefit of making my ideas legible and open to scrutiny.

### My qualifications

I have a Bachelor of Laws (LLB), a Bachelor of Commerce (BCom) (economics and finance), a Masters of Entrepreneurship degree, a Diploma in Financial Planning, and a Graduate Certificate in Professional Coaching. 

As a lawyer I've provided trust and estate planning services to many clients. I've also worked for many years as a financial services lawyer, working with banks, insurance companies, managed funds, and many financial advice businesses. 

Wearing a legal/compliance/risk hat, I've I've reviewed thousands of advice files prepared by hundreds of advisers, and spoken with dozens of advisers in depth about their business and advice processes. As a result of this, I saw excellent advice, and a lot of bad advice. This informed how I provide advice and operate Fairhaven Wealth.

I've met all the educational requirements necessary to be authorised to provide comprehensive financial advice.

#### How I maintain my competence, knowledge, and skills

I maintain my competence, knowledge, and skill in a variety of ways:

1. Continuous Learning:
	   
	- I read, listen to, and watch a wide range of resources relating to personal finance. I strive to be "promiscuous" in terms of where I source information, to get as many different perspectives as possible. On area in which I pay special attention is to regulatory changes. I try to retain a nuanced view on these changes: I want to understand what I can and can't do, the reasons and spirit behind these rules, and act according to these obligations (while also tryin to avoid "lawful-but-awful" conduct). Separate to this, I also sometimes have strong opinions on whether I think the regulatory rules are good or could be better, and also in terms of how effectively they are regulated. When there are changes that I feel strongly about, I make submissions in relation to them (for example: [my recent submission relating to the FMA's access to advice review](https://wealthandrisk.nz/access-to-advice-review-submission-2025/).)
    
	- Historically, I have used my blog, [Wealth & Risk](www.wealthandrisk.nz), as a context for putting my ideas in writing, working out what I actually think, interrogating these points, and developing the ability to communicate my thoughts and feelings.

	- Pursuing formal qualifications that align with what I am doing professionally at a given point in time. I completed my financial planning diploma while acting as a financial services lawyer, to better understand the world of financial advisers I was working with. I recently completed a graduate certificate in professional coaching because I felt like the skills and knowledge related to coaching were highly relevant to the work I was doing as a financial planner. 

2. Professional Engagement:

	- I've been a member of Financial Advice New Zealand (FANZ), where I served on the Risk Member Advisory Committee, advising the CEO and the board in relation to substantive matters impacting advisers in the industry, and was a founding member of the Canterbury region committee. I've previously been a member of the New Zealand Law Society, where I was a founding member of an Elder Law Special Interest Group. I've also held memberships with the New Zealand Institute of Directors and the Governance Institute of Australia. I'm not currently a member of any professional organisations, as I haven't found them relevant to my current needs. However, when that changes I don't hesitate to join these organisations and get involved.

3. Practical Experience:
	   
	- Working directly with clients has been one of the most valuable ways of maintaining my competency. In-depth conversations with thoughtful clients who ask valuable questions have been particularly beneficial. Even during periods when I'm not actively advising, I maintain informal discussions with peers and previous clients, which serves as a practical test of my ongoing competence.

4. Recent Focus and Return to Practice:

    - In the past two years, I have spent less time keeping up to date with financial advising specifically. During this time, I wasn't assisting clients and was unsure if I would return to this type of work. For a lot of this time, to the extent I was cultivating my knowledge/competence/skills, it was in domains that are adjacent to the services I provide via Fairhaven Wealth. In particular, coding to assist with data analysis, decision-making, and gaining insight into information. I am working on a variety of finance-related tools that I will make availble to Kiwis in due course. 
	
#### My biases and prejudices

I have biases and prejudices. I'm human: we all have 'em.

My bias is that it's impossible to have a one-size-fits-all approach to your finances (or life in general): we are all different, and our plans should be different. What works for your friend, family member, colleague, or neighbour may work for them. But that doesn't mean it'll work for you – because we're all unique people, with our own idiosyncratic circumstances, needs, values, and priorities.

I have a bias towards thinking of "wealth" beyond financial terms. I often speak in terms of people investing in their health and in their relationships, because I  believe that these are fundamental to a living a rich life. 

In terms of personal finance, my general belief is that the simpler you can keep your financial affairs, the better. A good goal is to make your financial life boring, so you can make the rest of your life interesting. ("As simple as possible, but not simpler.")

In terms of investing, I have something of an "inefficient market hypothesis". Specifically, I believe that most investments operate in inefficient markets. However, in many markets – particularly markets for shares in publicly-traded companies – the market is inefficient in ways that we can't predict, so we might as well treat it as efficient. Because of this, when it comes to shares, I have a bias towards investing in "passive" index-based funds. Instead of trying to beat the market, you should make sure that you don't get beaten by the market. 

Other markets, however, are inefficient, and "active" investment might be appropriate. This relates to property investment, investing in personal ventures, and even in terms of investing in human capital. These are markets where there are inefficiencies that you might be able to exploit if you have the right talents and inclinations.

I think that many of our biggest financial risks can't be insured against. These include professional risks (such as being displaced from the workforce) and risks associated with relationship break-downs. 

Having said this, I believe that some risks can be insured against, and I consider insurance to be a wonder of the modern world – similar to vaccines. Insurance is a mechanism for sharing risk with other people. Insurance companies facilitate these arrangements, and make a profit in doing so, but *someone* has to do it, and without these organisations, much of this risk-sharing wouldn't be happening. I don't envy their role in trying to assess and price risk, and making sure that payouts are only made in appropriate cases, and I'm grateful that they exist to do this. Having said that, I am mindful that many people are over-insured, paying premiums to manage risks that are no longer relevant to them. 

I have a slight bias towards people decumulating capital over the course of their retirement rather than "living off the interest" or "the interest of the interest". There might be situations where this is appropriate, but it is often an indicator that people are prioritising money over other aspects of life. 

My bias is to be distrustful of advice influenced strongly by conflicts of interest. I subscribe to the view of "show me the incentives and I'll show you the outcomes". 

Having said all of the above, I believe there is room for genuine good faith debate about all of these things, and I also appreciate that people can legitimately weigh different things in different ways. 

Ultimately, I'm biased towards recognising that I'm not the final authority on anything (even aspects of my own life!). I urge my clients to push back and challenge me on anything I say. I encourage people to "question the question". 

I believe that _you_  are the final authority of or your own life.

#### How I invest my own money

In my blog, I've been pretty transparent regarding how I approach my own finances. The most recent detailed update was in 2019 where I explained ["How I money"](https://wealthandrisk.nz/how-i-money/). Not much has changed since then.

#### Can you work with clients who already have advisers?

Yes. A number of my clients already have relationships with advisers and engage me for a fresh perspective in relation to their financial affairs. 

Because I provide an advice-only service, you can engage me and this won't interrupt your current engagement with your existing adviser at all.

## Conflicts of interest: as independent as possible

When I set up Fairhaven Wealth, I did it so I could follow what I call the "family and friends rule". That is, I would provide my clients with the same guidance  I'd provide to close friends and family members if they were in your position. In fact, I recommend what I would do if I were in your shoes.

Many financial service providers say they are "independent" or "unbiased", or market themselves as "fiduciaries". I often consider these descriptions to be misleading. With Fairhaven Wealth, I have structured the business so that my interests are as aligned with my clients as much as humanly possible. 

### The only remuneration I receive is directly from clients. 

The only remuneration I receive is from clients. I invoice and clients pay me directly. Third parties don't pay me or provide me with any benefits that represent incentives-in-disguise. I don't have opaque payment arrangements where fees are paid via third parties. I don't receive commission. I don't receive money that is tied to how clients implement my adivce. 

I'm the sole shareholder of Fairhaven Ventures Ltd and receive income in the form of drawings from the business. 

### My conflicts of interest

Fairhaven Wealth has been structured so that conflicts of interest are *avoided*, rather than *managed.*

In this sense, Fairhaven Wealth doesn't have any substantive conflicts of interest, compared to financial service providers who focus on managing conflicts rather than avoiding them. 

Fairhaven Wealth doesn't have any relationship with third parties that might influence its service. Of note:

* I don't have any formal referral arrangements that involve fees or anything of that nature. If I refer someone to another professional, the only reason I make this referral is because I believe there is a good fit with the person and the service that professional is likely to provide. I don't receive anything in return from that professional for the referral – except the peace of mind of knowing that they won't embarrass me by providing a sub-standard service.

* Over time, I've developed professional and personal relationships with people from different organisations, including people who work with certain financial providers. However, I prioritise my independence and the interests of my clients over these relationships.

For my main service, even income received by clients is only received in full if they are satisfied with the service and it meets their expectations. 

To the extent Fairhaven Wealth has a conflict of interest, it is that Fairhaven Wealth's primary service involves charging fixed fees. Arguably, this creates an incentive for me to spend as little time as possible on the service. The main way I have managed this is by charging on the basis of a "5-star payment policy". Offering one-off services also creates an incentive for me to provide high quality services, because I won't receive additional work from existing clients, or receive referrals, unless the service I provide is of sufficiently high quality. 

One other subtle conflict of interest, that is present for any service provider, is the inclination to want to CMA, or "cover my ass". This can create a situation where an adviser might be tempted to be over-cautious because they don't want to expose clients to risk that might in turn expose them to risk. This is the case even if the clients might have a higher appetite for risk and be prepared to take on risk, in a fully informed manner. This is one central reason why I don't provide cookie-cutter advice: I provide all of my advice in the context of my clients' circumstances, needs, and objectives. On top of this, the best I can do is be up-front about this, mindful of it, communicate it, and do my best to ensure that conversations don't end up being a personal Rorschach test.
