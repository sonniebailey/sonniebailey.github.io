# We help you to make financial decisions that align with your values.

Fairhaven Wealth is different. We provide one-off services for switched-on Kiwis who want to retain control of their financial lives. We've done everything we can to avoid the conflicts of interest that are common in the financial services industry. 

We charge $350 per hour or $5,000 for a fixed-price service (including GST).
