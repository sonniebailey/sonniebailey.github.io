# Financial insight through meaningful conversation


We help you make financial decisions that align with your values and priorities. 

Fairhaven Wealth is different. We provide one-off services for switched-on Kiwis. We help you make the financial decisions that are facing you right now, without locking you into an ongoing service arrangement. We have done everything we can to avoid the conflicts of interest that are common in the financial services industry. 

Our engagements are short-term. We charge $350 per hour or $5,000 for a fixed-price service (including GST). 

We work with only one client at a time.
