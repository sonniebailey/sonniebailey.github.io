# Financial insight through meaningful conversation

Fairhaven Wealth offers something different.

We don't want to touch your money. We don't want to tell you what to do. We don't want to lock you into an ongoing service arrangement. We just want to help *you* make *your own decisions*.

Our unique service helps you to gain the clarity and confidence to make financial decisions that truly align with your values â€“ without the conflicts of interest common in the financial services industry.
